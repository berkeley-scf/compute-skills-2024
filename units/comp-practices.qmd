# 1. Our running example: Newton's method for optimization

## Newton's method background

We'll use a running example, Newton's method for optimization, during this workshop. It's simple enough to be straightforward to code but can involve various modifications, extensions, etc. to be a rich enough example that we can use it to demonstrate various topics and tools.

Recall that Newton's method works as follows to optimize some objective function, $f(x)$, as a function of univariate or multivariate $x$, where $f(x)$ is univariate. 

Newton's method is iterative. If we are at step $t-1$, the next value (when minimizing a function) is:

$$
x_t = x_{t-1} - f^{\prime}(x_{t-1}) / f^{\prime\prime}(x_{t-1})
$$

Here are the steps:

- determine a starting value, $x_0$
- iterate:
  - at step $t$, the next value (the update) is given by the equation above
  - stop when $\left\Vert x_{t} - x_{t-1} \right\Vert$ is "small"

You can derive it by finding the root of the gradient function using a Taylor series approximation to the gradient.

## Exercise: Implement univariate Newton's method


Here's what you'll need your code to do:

- accept a starting value, $x_0$, and the function, $f(\cdot)$, to optimize
- implement the iterative algorithm
- implement the stopping criterion (feel free to keep this simple)
- calculate the first and second derivatives using a basic finite difference approach to estimating the derivative based on the definition of a derivative as a limit
    - note that the second derivative can be seen as calling the first derivative twice...
- consider what to return as the output (feel free to keep it simple)
- don't worry much for now about making your code robust or dealing with tricky situations


   
::: {.callout-warning}
Don't make your finite difference ("epsilon") too small or you'll actually get inaccurate estimates. (We'll discuss why when we talk a bit out numerical issues in computing later.)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
For now, please do not use any Python packages that provide finite difference-based derivatives (we'll do that later, and it's helpful to have more code available for the work we'll do today).

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
You're welcome to develop your code in a Notebook or in the DataHub editor or in a separate editor on your laptop.
:::

Once you've written your Python functions, put your code into a simple text file, called `newton.py`. In doing so you've created a Python *module*. Once you have your module, you can use it like this:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import newton
newton.optimize(start, fun)   ## Assuming your function is called `optimize`.
newton.optimize(2.5, np.cos)  ## Minimizing cos(x) from close-ish to one minimum.
```

A *module* is a collection of related code in a file with the extension `.py`.
The code can include functions, classes, and variables, as well as
runnable code. To access the objects in the module, you need to import the module.


# 2. Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Exercise: Creating a Git repository (on GitHub)

Go to `github.com/<your_username>` and click on the `Repositories` tag. Then click on the `New` button.

- In the form, give the repository the name `newton-practice` (so others who are working with you can find it easily)
- Provide a short description
- Click on "Add a README file".
- Leave the repository as "Public" so that others can interact with your repository when we practice later.
- Scroll down to `Python` under `Add .gitignore`.
- Select a license (the BSD 3 Clause license is a good "permissive" one).

::: {.callout-note}
## Creating repositories on your laptop first
It's also possible to [create the repository from the terminal on your machine](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#initializing-a-git-repository) and then link it to your GitHub account, but that's a couple extra steps we won't go into here at the moment.

:::

## Accessing  GitHub repositories from DataHub

Authenticating with GitHub can be a bit tricky, particularly when using DataHub (i.e., JupyterHub).

Please see [these instructions](../prep.qmd#accessing-github-repositories-from-datahub).

## Basic use of a repository

In the terminal, let's make a small change to the README, register the change with Git (this is called a *commit*), and push the changes upstream to GitHub (which has the *remote* copy of the repository).

#### Step 1. Clone the repository

First make a local copy of the repository from the remote on GitHub. It's best do this **outside** of the `compute-skills-2024` directory; otherwise you'll have a repository nested within a repository. 

```bash
cd  # Avoid cloning into the `compute-skills-2024` repository.
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/newton-practice
```

If we run this:

```bash
cd newton-practice
ls -l .git
cat .git/config
```

we should see a bunch of output (truncated here) indicating that `newton-practice` is a Git repository, and that in this case the local repository is linked to a *remote* repository (the repository we created on GitHub):

```bash
total 40
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan  264 Aug  2 15:04 config
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan   73 Aug  2 15:04 description
-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan jovyan   21 Aug  2 15:04 HEAD
-rw-r--r--   1 paciorek scfstaff   16 Jul 24 14:48 COMMIT_EDITMSG
-rw-r--r--   1 paciorek scfstaff  656 Jul 23 18:20 config
<snip>

<snip>
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/paciorek/newton-practice
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
<snip>
```

Step 2. Add files

Next move (or copy) your Python module into the repository directory. I'll use the test module that we'll work with later, but you'll do it with your Newton method module.

```bash
cd newton-practice
cp ../compute-skills-2024/units/binary_search.py .
## Tell git to track the file
git add binary_search.py
```

Step 3. Edit file(s)

Edit the README file to indicate that the repository has a basic implementation
of Newton's method. (In DataHub, you can double-click on the README in the file manager
pane.)

```bash
git status
## Tell git to keep track of the changes to the file.
git add README.md
git status
```

```bash
## Register the changes with Git.
git commit -m"Add basic implementation of Newton's method."
git status
## Synchronize the changes with the remote.
git push
```

::: {.callout-note}
We could have cloned the (public) repository without the `gh_scoped_creds` credentials stuff earlier, but if we tried to push to it, we would have been faced with GitHub asking for our password, which would have required us to create a GitHub authentication token that we would paste in.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Instead of having to `add` files that already part of the repository (such as `README.md`) we could do:
```bash
git commit -a -m"Update README."
```
We do need to explicitly add any **new** files (e.g., `newton.py`) that are not yet registered with git via `git add`.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
You can also edit and add files directly to your GitHub repository in a browser window. This is a good backup if you run into problems making commits from DataHub or your laptop.
:::


### Writing good commit messages

Some tips:

- Concisely describe what changed (and for more complicated situations, why), not how.
- Two options (depending on whether the commit makes one or more changes):
  - Keep it short (one line, <72 characters)
  - Have a subject line separated from the body by a blank line.
      - Keep subject to 50 characters and each body line to 72 characters.
      - Best to edit message in an editor -- omit the `-m` flag to `git commit`.
- If you're working on a project with GitHub issues, reference the issue at the bottom.
- Start each item in the message with a verb (present tense) and provide a complete sentence.

If you find your commit message is covering multiple topics, it probably means you should
have made multiple ("atomic") commits.

## Exercise: code review

#### Step 1: Make suggestions

Go to your partner's repository at `https://github.com/<user_name>/newton-practice`.

1. Look over their code.
2. Make some comments/suggestions in a new GitHub issue (go to the `Issues` button and click on `New issue`).

#### Step 2: Respond to suggestions

In response to your partner's comments, make some small change(s) to your `newton.py` code.

You can do this in DataHub (or locally on your laptop if that's what you're doing) and make a commit as we did in the previous exercise.

Or you can do the editing in your GitHub browser window by clicking on the file and choosing the pencil icon (far right) to edit it. When you save it, a commit will be made. Make sure to provide a commit message. You can also create new files via the `+` button in the top of the left sidebar. If you make changes directly on GitHub, you'll also want to run `git pull` to pull down the changes to your local repository on DataHub or your laptop.

# 3. Understanding Git

::: {.callout-note}
## More than the syntax

So far we've just introduced Git by its mechanics/syntax. This is ok (but not ideal) for basic one-person operation, but to really use Git effectively you need to understand conceptually how it works.

More generally if you understand things conceptually, then looking up the syntax of a command or the mechanics of how to do something will be straightforward.

:::

We'll start with some visuals and then go back to some Git terminology and to the structure of a repository.

## Git visuals: Understanding Git concepts

Fernando Perez has nice visualization ([online version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YlM3boYLE8DwbxGNO3ZVVt3e9gEoBgD1uc9RtItUYCU), [PDF version](git_visuals.pdf)) of a basic Git workflow that we'll walk through.

Note that we haven't actually seen in prtacie some of what is shown in the visual: tags, branches, and merging, but we'll be using those ideas later.


## Key components and terminology

### Commits

A *commit* is a snapshot of our work at a point in time. So far in our own repository, we've been working with a linear sequence of snapshots, but the visualization showed that we can actually have a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of snapshots once we have *branches*.

Each commit has:

 - a hash identifier - a unique identifier produced by hashing the changes introduced in the commit and also the parent commit,
 - hashes of the files in the repository in their current state, and
 - the changes (based on the `diff` tool) relative to the parent commit.

### A repository

A *repository* is the set of files for a project with their history. It's a collection of commits in the form of an directed acyclic graph.

![A (simple) Git repository (Credit: ProGit book, CC License)](tree.png)

Some other terms:

- HEAD: a pointer to the current commit
- tag: a label for a commit
- branch: a commit - often indicating a commit that has "branched" off of some main workflow or some linear sequence of commits

### Staging area / index

The index (staging area) keeps track of changes (made to tracked files) that are added, but that are not yet committed.

![local operations in a repository (Credit: ProGit book, CC License)](staging.png "Visualization of local operations in Git")

::: {.callout-tip}
## Rolling back changes (optional)

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Uncommitted changes

If I make some changes to a file that I decide are a mistaken, before `git add` (i.e., before registering/staging the changes with `git`), I can always still edit the file to undo the mistakes.

But I can also go back to the version stored by Git.

```bash
# git checkout -- file.txt  # This is older syntax.
git restore file.txt
```

## Staged, uncommitted changes

If we've added (staged) files via `git add` but have not yet committed them,
the files are in the index (staging area). We can get those changes out
of the staging area like this:

```bash
git status
# git reset HEAD file.txt  # This is older syntax.
git restore --staged file.txt
git status
```

Note that the changes still exist in `file.txt` but they're no longer registered/staged with Git.

## Committed changes

Suppose you need to add or modify to your commit. This illustrates a few things you might do to update your commit.

```bash
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git add forgotten_file.txt
# Edit file.txt.
git add file.txt
# Get version of file from previous commit.
git checkout <commit_hash> file.txt
git commit --amend
```

## Pushed changes

```bash
git revert <commit_hash>
git push
```

Note that this creates a new commit that undoes the changes you don't want. So the undoing shows up in the history.
This is the safest option.

If you're *sure* no one else has pulled your changes from the remote:

```bash
git reset <commit_hash>
# Make changes
git commit -a -m'reworked the mistake'
git push -f origin <branch_name>
```

This will remove the previous commit at the remote (GitHub in our case).

# 4. Code style and documentation

Having a (reasonably) consistent and clean style, plus documentation, is important for being able to
read and maintain your code.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Q: Who is the person most likely to use your code again?

A: You, but at some point in the future by which you will have forgotten what the code does and why.

I can't tell you how many times I've looked back at my
own code and been amazed at how little I remember and frustrated with the former self who wrote it.
:::

A go-to reference on Python code style is the [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008). That said, it's extensive, quite detailed, and hard to absorb quickly.

Here are a few key suggestions:

- Indentation:
    - Python is strict about indentation of course.
    - Use 4 spaces per indentation level (avoid tabs if possible).
- Whitespace: use it in a variety of places. Some places where it is good to have it
    are
    - around operators (assignment and arithmetic), e.g., `x = x * 3`;
    - between function arguments, e.g., `myfun(x, 3, data)`;
    - between list/tuple elements, e.g., `x = [3, 5, 7]`; and
    - between matrix/array indices, e.g., `x[3, :4]`.
- Use blank lines to separate blocks of code with comments to say what
    the block does.
- Use whitespaces or parentheses for clarity even if not needed for order of
    operations. For example, `a/y*x` will work but is not easy to read
    and you can easily induce a bug if you forget the order of ops. Instead,
    use `a/y * x` or `(a/y) * x`.
- Avoid code lines longer than 79 characters and comment/docstring lines
    longer than 72 characters.
- Comments:
    - Add comments to explain why, not how.
    - Don't belabor the obvious; avoid things like `x = x + 1  # Increment x.`.
    - Some key things to document:
      - summarizing a block of code,
      - explaining a complicated piece of code or particular construction, and
      - explaining non-obvious values or steps, such as `x = x + 1 # Compensate for image border.`
    - Comments should generally be complete sentences.
- You can use parentheses to group operations such that they can be split up into lines
  and easily commented, e.g.,
  ```{python}
  #| eval: false
  newdf = (
          pd.read_csv('file.csv')                   # 1988 census data.
          .rename(columns = {'STATE': 'us_state'})  # Adjust column names.
          .dropna()                                 # Remove rows with missing values.
          )
  ```
- Being consistent about the naming style for objects and functions is hard, but try to be consistent. PEP8 suggests:
    - Class names should be UpperCamelCase.
    - Function, method, and variable names should be snake_case, e.g., `number_of_its` or `n_its`.
    - Non-public methods and variables should have a leading underscore.
- Try to have the names be informative without being overly long.
- Don't overwrite names of objects/functions that already exist in the language. E.g., don't use `len` in Python. That said, the namespace system helps with the unavoidable cases where there are name conflicts.
- Use active names for functions (e.g., `calc_loglik`, `calc_log_lik`
    rather than `loglik` or `loglik_calc`). Functions are akin to verbs.
- Learn from others' code

## Linting

Linting is the process of applying a tool to your code to enforce style.

We'll demo using `ruff` to some example code. You might also consider `black`.

We'll practice with `ruff` with a small module we'll use next also for debugging.

- First, we check for and fix syntax errors.
  ```bash
  ruff check binary_search.py
  ```
- Then we ask `ruff` to reformat to conform to standard style.
  ```bash
  ruff format binary_search.py
  ```

Let's see what changed:

```bash
diff binary_search_orig.py binary_search.py
```

## Exercise: add documentation and comments to your Newton module

1. Add a [doc string](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257) to each of your functions. Focus on your main function. Take a look at an example, such as `help(numpy.linalg.cholesky)` to see the different parts and the format.
2. Consider whether to add comments to your code.
3. Apply `ruff` to your code.
4. Compare the results with the style suggestions above and do additional reformatting as needed.
5. Commit and push to GitHub. Remember to have a good commit message!

# 5. Debugging

Once you start writing more complicated code, even in an interpreted language such as Python that you can run line-by-line, you'll want to use a debugger, particularly when you have nested function calls.

Debugging can be a slow process, so you typically start a debugging session by deciding which line in your code you would like to start tracing the behavior from, and you place a *breakpoint*. Then you can have the debugger run the program up to that point and stop at it, allowing you to:

1. inspect the current state of variables,
2. step through the code line by line,
3. step over or into functions as they are called, and
4. resume program execution.


The *stack* is the series of nested function calls. When an error occurs, Python will print the *stack trace* showing the sequence of calls leading to the error. This can be helpful and distracting/confusing.

We'll use the debugger in JupyterLab; similar functionality is in VS Code. And you can use `pdb` directly from the command line; the ideas are all the same.

## Demo: debugging the `binary_search` example

### Using the JupyterLab visual debugger

The function `binary_search()` in the `binary_search.py` module attempts to do a binary search for an item in a sorted list. It looks in the middle of the list and if the value in the list is larger than the item, it recurses to look in the first half of the list, otherwise in the second half. It continues in this fashion until it is down to a single item and then checks if that item is what is being searched for.

```{python}
import binary_search as bs
bs.search([3,7,9,13,17,203,205],3)
```
```{python}
bs.search([3,7,9,13,17,203,205],13)
```
```{python}
bs.search([3,7,9,13,17,203,205],17)
```

Clearly that doesn't always work. Let's debug the failing case.

We'll work in our Jupyter notebook.

- First turn on debugging capability by clicking on the small "bug" icon of the top navigation bar under the file tabs and to the left of the  info about the kernel.
- Next we click on a line of code to set a breakpoint (or add `breakpoint()` in a line of a source file).
- Now we run the function by executing the cell containing the function call. We can:
  - continue (to the end or the next breakpoint),
  - run the next line,
  - step (in/down) into a nested function, or
  - step (out/up) out of a function.


### Using the IPython debugger (`ipdb`)

We can use the IPython `%debug` "magic" to activate a debugger as well.

One way this is particularly useful is "post-mortem" debugging, i.e., debugging when exceptions (errors) have occurred. We just invoke `%debug` and then (re)run the code that is failing.

Once in the ipdb debugger, we can use these commands (most of which correspond to icons we used to control the JupyterLab debugger behavior

- `p expr` to print the result of the `expr` code
- `c` to continue execution (until the end or the next breakpoint)
- `n` to run the next line of code
- `u` and `d` to step up and down through the stack of function calls
- `q` to quit the debugger

We'll put a silly error into the `binary_search` code, restart the kernel, and use the post-mortem debugging approach as an illustration.

## Exercise: debugging your Newton code

Run your Newton method on the following function, $x^4/4 - x^3 -x$.
Sometimes it should fail.

Use the debugger to try to see what goes wrong. (For our purposes here, do this using the debugger; don't figure it out from first principles mathematically or graphically.)

Conditional breakpoints are a useful tool that causes the debugger to stop at a breakpoint only if some condition is true (e.g., if some extreme value is reached in the Newton iterations). I don't see that it's possible to do this with the JupyterLab debugger, but with the `ipdb` debugger you can do things like this to debug a particular line of a particular file if a condition (here `x==5`) is met:

```
b path/to/script.py:999, x==5
```

# 6. Defensive programming, error checking and testing

## Demo: Unit tests and `pytest`

`pytest` is a very popular package/framework for testing. 

We create test functions that check for the expected result.

We use `assert` statements. These are ways of generally setting up sanity checks in your code. They are usually used in development, or perhaps data analysis workflows, rather than production code. They are a core part of setting up tests such as here with `pytest`.

```bash
pytest test_bs.py
```

## Exercise: Test cases

With a partner, brainstorm some test cases for your implementation of Newton's method in terms of the user's function and input values a user might provide.

In addition to cases where it should succeed, you'll want to consider cases where Newton's method fails and test whether the user gets an informative result. Of course as a starting point, the case we used for the debugging exercise is a good one for a failing case. 

We'll collect some possible tests once each group has had a chance to brainstorm.

## Exercise: Unit tests

We'll implement our test cases as unit tests using the `pytest` package.

Include tests for:

- successful optimization
- unsuccessful optimization
- invalid user inputs

with the expected output being what you *want* to happen, not necessarily what your function does.

You'll want cases where you know the correct answer. Start simple.

::: {.callout-caution}
## Only write tests now
For now don't modify your code even if you start to suspect how it might fail. Writing the tests and then modifying code so they pass is an example of *test-driven development*.
:::

## Exercise: Error trapping, robust code, and defensive programming

Now we'll try to go beyond simply returning a failed result and see if we can trap problems early on and write more robust code. 

Work on the following improvements:

- Check user inputs are valid.
- Add warnings to the user if it seems that Newton's method is taking a bad step.
- Modify your function so that when it fails, the result is informative to the user.
  - Include a success/failure code (flag) in your output.

We don't have time to go fully into how Python handles errors (called exceptions). Here are a few basic things you can do to *raise* an *exception* (i.e., to report an error):

```
if not callable(f):
   raise TypeError(f"Argument is not a function, it is of type {type(f)}")
```

```
if x > 1e7:
   raise RuntimeError(f"At iteration {iter}, optimization appears to be diverging")
```

```
import warnings
if x > 3:
   warnings.warn(f"{x} is greater than 3.")
```  

Next, if you have time, consider robustifying your code if you have time:

- What might you do if the next step is worse than the current position?  
- What might you do if the next step is outside the range of potential values (assuming a unimodal function)? 

# 7. Multi-user Git

Once you are working on more complicated projects and particularly when working with multiple people, you'll want to be able to use branches and pull requests (PRs) to manage the work.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Why use branches and pull requests?

- Experiment without worrying about breaking the current code.
- Test your code before finalizing changes (particularly with testing via continuous integration / GitHub Actions).
- Organize aspects of the project for clarity and collaboration.
- Manage collaboration:
   - Manage code contributions from others.
   - Discuss changes.
   - Keep track of changes.
   - Accept external contributions.
   - Resolve conflicts between different changes.
:::

Before going further, let's review our visualization of working with Git ([online version](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YlM3boYLE8DwbxGNO3ZVVt3e9gEoBgD1uc9RtItUYCU), [PDF version](git_visuals.pdf))

## Demo: Branching and pull requests, merge conflicts

We'll demo the use of branching and PRs by fixing our `binary_search` function.

### Branching

First, let's fix the error in our `binary_search` function in a new branch.

```bash
git switch -c fix_midpoint_bug
```

We'll now make the fixes and do the linting (not shown).

Push the branch with the fix to GitHub.

```bash
git add binary_search.py
git commit -m"Fix bug in handling midpoint.

Lint code."
git push -u origin fix_midpoint_bug
```

### Pull requests

Now we'll go to GitHub and start a pull request (PR).

Since we're the ones who control the repo, we'll also review and merge in the PR.

### Merge conflicts

Next let's see a basic example of a *merge conflict*, which occurs when two commits modify (which could include deletion) the same line in a file. In this case Git requires the user to figure out what should be done.

To get an example, we need to create a conflict. I will add different documentation in the `main` and `fix_midpoint_bug` branches. After pushing the `main` change, I'll try to do a PR with the `fix_midpoint_bug`.

The GitHub UI does a nice job of helping you resolve merge conflicts, as we'll see.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Resolving conflicts at the command line

You can also get (and resolve) merge conflicts on the command line. Git will add some syntax to the conflicted file pointing out the conflicts that need to be resolved. Once you edit the conflicted file to fix the conflict, you can do `git add <name_of_file>` and then `git commit`.
:::

## Multivariate Newton's method

Recall that Newton's method optimizes some objective function, $f(x)$ as a function of univariate or multivariate $x$, where $f(x)$ is univariate.

The multivariate method extends the univariate, using the gradient (first derivative) vector and Hessian (second derivative) matrix.

If we are at step $t-1$, the next value is:

$$
x_{t+1}=x_{t}-H_{f}(x_{t})^{-1}\nabla f(x_{t})
$$

where $\nabla f(x_{t}$ is the gradient (first derivative with respect to each element of $x$) and $H_{f}(x_{t})$ is the Hessian matrix (second derivatives with respect to all pairs of the elements of $x$).


Here are the steps:

- determine a starting value, $x_0$.
- iterate:
  - at step $t$, the next value (the update) is given by the equation above
  - stop when $\left\Vert x_{t} - x_{t-1} \right\Vert$ is "small"

## Exercise: Branching

Working with a partner:

1. Choose either your repository or your partner's repository to continue working in.
2. Make a branch (called `multivariate`) in which you'll implement the multivariate version of Newton's method (see details above)
3. Implement the algorithm.

At this point, if we think about calculating the Hessian it starts to feel more tedious to deal with the finite difference calculations, though it is a straightforward extension of what you already implemented. Feel free to look online to find a Python package that implements finite difference estimation of derivatives and use that in your code.

As you are writing the code, you can continue to think about what might go wrong and include defensive programming tactics. 

## Exercise: Pull requests (PRs)

When you have your branch ready, make a pull request:

1. Make a pull request into the remote for the repository by pushing the branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push -u origin multivariate
   ```
   
2. Go to GitHub to the `Pull requests` tab and make the PR, making a note of what the PR is about.

Don't (yet) merge in the PR. We want someone else to review it to have additional eyes on the code.

## Exercise: Code review

Now you and your partner should find a separate group with which to work on code reviews as a "supergroup".

Give the other group the URL for your repository on GitHub and ask them to look at the PR.
In turn get the URL for their repository.

In reviewing the PR, make comments in the PR comment/conversation area on GitHub. You and your partner can work together to make comments or you can each make separate comments.

If you have time, explore these two additional options for making comments:

1. Review changes:
   - Click on the `Files changed` tab (or go to `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/newton-practice/pull/<PULL_ID>/files` for the specific "PULL_ID").
   - Click on the `Review changes` button.
2. Make comments on specific lines
   - Click on the `Files changed` tab (or go to `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/newton-practice/pull/<PULL_ID>/files` for the specific "PULL_ID").
   - Hover over a specific line in a specific file with your mouse. A blue "plus" box should appear. Click on the plus to add a comment.
   - Click on `Add single comment` or optionally experiment with `Start a review`.

## Exercise: Merge the PR

Once you've seen the review by the other group, with your partner:

- On DataHub, make changes to the branch that was used in the pull request.
  - Alternatively, you could make the changes directly on GitHub using its editing capabilities.
- On DataHub, commit and push to GitHub.
- On GitHub, merge in the pull request and close the request.
  - You may want to delete the branch. This helps avoid having a profusion of unneeded branches.
- On DataHub, run `git pull` to get the changes updated in the `main` branch of your local repository.
